# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the _R Markdown_ thesis template. This template is based on (and in many places copied directly from) the Reed College LaTeX template, but hopefully it will provide a nicer interface for those that have never used TeX or LaTeX before.  Using _R Markdown_ will also allow you to easily keep track of your analyses in **R** chunks of code, with the resulting plots and output included as well.  The hope is this _R Markdown_ template gets you in the habit of doing reproducible research, which benefits you long-term as a researcher, but also will greatly help anyone that is trying to reproduce or build onto your results down the road.

Hopefully, you won't have much of a learning period to go through and you will reap the benefits of a nicely formatted thesis.  The use of LaTeX in combination with _Markdown_ is more consistent than the output of a word processor, much less prone to corruption or crashing, and the resulting file is smaller than a Word file. While you may have never had problems using Word in the past, your thesis is likely going to be about twice as large and complex as anything you've written before, taxing Word's capabilities.  After working with _Markdown_ and **R** together for a few weeks, we are confident this will be your reporting style of choice going forward.

<!-- 
If you're still on the fence about using _R Markdown_, check out the resource for newbies available at <https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/> or email us at <data@reed.edu>. 
-->

**Why use it?**

_R Markdown_ creates a simple and straightforward way to interface with the beauty of LaTeX.  Packages have been written in **R** to work directly with LaTeX to produce nicely formatting tables and paragraphs. In addition to creating a user friendly interface to LaTeX, _R Markdown_ also allows you to read in your data, to analyze it and to visualize it using **R** functions, and also to provide the documentation and commentary on the results of your project.  Further, it allows for **R** results to be passed inline to the commentary of your results.  You'll see more on this later.  

<!-- 
Having your code and commentary all together in one place has a plethora of benefits!
-->

**Who should use it?**

Anyone who needs to use data analysis, math, tables, a lot of figures, complex cross-references, or who just cares about the final appearance of their document should use _R Markdown_. Of particular use should be anyone in the sciences, but the user-friendly nature of _Markdown_ and its ability to keep track of and easily include figures, automatically generate a table of contents, index, references, table of figures, etc. should make it of great benefit to nearly anyone writing a thesis project.

# R Markdown Basics {#rmd-basics}

Here is a brief introduction into using _R Markdown_. _Markdown_ is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. _R Markdown_ provides the flexibility of _Markdown_ with the implementation of **R** input and output.  For more details on using _R Markdown_ see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.  

Be careful with your spacing in _Markdown_ documents.  While whitespace largely is ignored, it does at times give _Markdown_ signals as to how to proceed.  As a habit, try to keep everything left aligned whenever possible, especially as you type a new paragraph.  In other words, there is no need to indent basic text in the Rmd document (in fact, it might cause your text to do funny things if you do).

## Lists

It's easy to create a list.  It can be unordered like

* Item 1
* Item 2

or it can be ordered like

1. Item 1
4. Item 2

Notice that I intentionally mislabeled Item 2 as number 4.  _Markdown_ automatically figures this out!  You can put any numbers in the list and it will create the list.  Check it out below.

To create a sublist, just indent the values a bit (at least four spaces or a tab).  (Here's one case where indentation is key!)

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
    - Item 3a
    - Item 3b

## Line breaks

Make sure to add white space between lines if you'd like to start a new paragraph.  Look at what happens below in the outputted document if you don't:

Here is the first sentence.  Here is another sentence.  Here is the last sentence to end the paragraph.
This should be a new paragraph.

*Now for the correct way:* 

Here is the first sentence.  Here is another sentence.  Here is the last sentence to end the paragraph.

This should be a new paragraph.

## R chunks

When you click the **Knit** button above a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded **R** code chunks within the document. You can embed an **R** code chunk like this (`cars` is a built-in **R** dataset):

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Inline code

If you'd like to put the results of your analysis directly into your discussion, add inline code like this:

> The `cos` of $2 \pi$ is `r cos(2*pi)`. 

Another example would be the direct calculation of the standard deviation:

> The standard deviation of `speed` in `cars` is `r sd(cars$speed)`.

One last neat feature is the use of the `ifelse` conditional statement which can be used to output text depending on the result of an **R** calculation:

> `r ifelse(sd(cars$speed) < 6, "The standard deviation is less than 6.", "The standard deviation is equal to or greater than 6.")`

Note the use of `>` here, which signifies a quotation environment that will be indented.

As you see with `$2 \pi$` above, mathematics can be added by surrounding the mathematical text with dollar signs.  More examples of this are in [Mathematics and Science] if you uncomment the code in [Math].  

## Including plots

You can also embed plots.  For example, here is a way to use the base **R** graphics package to produce a plot using the built-in `pressure` dataset:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo=FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the **R** code that generated the plot.  There are plenty of other ways to add chunk options.  More information is available at <http://yihui.name/knitr/options/>.  

Another useful chunk option is the setting of `cache=TRUE` as you see here.  If document rendering becomes time consuming due to long computations or plots that are expensive to generate you can use knitr caching to improve performance.  Later in this file, you'll see a way to reference plots created in **R** or external figures.

## Loading and exploring data

Included in this template is a file called `flights.csv`.  This file includes a subset of the larger dataset of information about all flights that departed from Seattle and Portland in 2014.  More information about this dataset and its **R** package is available at <http://github.com/ismayc/pnwflights14>.  This subset includes only Portland flights and only rows that were complete with no missing values.  Merges were also done with the `airports` and `airlines` data sets in the `pnwflights14` package to get more descriptive airport and airline names.

We can load in this data set using the following command:

```{r load_data}
flights <- read.csv("data/flights.csv")
```

The data is now stored in the data frame called `flights` in **R**.  To get a better feel for the variables included in this dataset we can use a variety of functions.  Here we can see the dimensions (rows by columns) and also the names of the columns.

```{r str}
dim(flights)
names(flights)
```

Another good idea is to take a look at the dataset in table form.  With this dataset having more than 50,000 rows, we won't explicitly show the results of the command here.  I recommend you enter the command into the Console **_after_** you have run the **R** chunks above to load the data into **R**.

```{r view_flights, eval=FALSE}
View(flights)
```

While not required, it is highly recommended you use the `dplyr` package to manipulate and summarize your data set as needed.  It uses a syntax that is easy to understand using chaining operations.  Below I've created a few examples of using `dplyr` to get information about the Portland flights in 2014.  You will also see the use of the `ggplot2` package, which produces beautiful, high-quality academic visuals.

We begin by checking to ensure that needed packages are installed and then we load them into our current working environment:

```{r load_pkgs, message=FALSE}
# List of packages required for this analysis
pkg <- c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "knitr", "bookdown", "devtools")
# Check if packages are not installed and assign the
# names of the packages not installed to the variable new.pkg
new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages())]
# If there are any packages in the list that aren't installed,
# install them
if (length(new.pkg))
  install.packages(new.pkg, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
# Load packages (thesisdown will load all of the packages as well)
library(thesisdown)
```

\clearpage

The example we show here does the following:

- Selects only the `carrier_name` and `arr_delay` from the `flights` dataset and then assigns this subset to a new variable called `flights2`. 

- Using `flights2`, we determine the largest arrival delay for each of the carriers.

```{r max_delays}
flights2 <- flights %>% 
  select(carrier_name, arr_delay)
max_delays <- flights2 %>% 
  group_by(carrier_name) %>%
  summarize(max_arr_delay = max(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

A useful function in the `knitr` package for making nice tables in _R Markdown_ is called `kable`.  It is much easier to use than manually entering values into a table by copying and pasting values into Excel or LaTeX.  This again goes to show how nice reproducible documents can be! (Note the use of `results="asis"`, which will produce the table instead of the code to create the table.)  The `caption.short` argument is used to include a shorter title to appear in the List of Tables.

```{r maxdelays, results="asis"}
kable(max_delays, 
      col.names = c("Airline", "Max Arrival Delay"),
      caption = "Maximum Delays by Airline",
      caption.short = "Max Delays by Airline",
      longtable = TRUE,
      booktabs = TRUE)
```

The last two options make the table a little easier-to-read.

We can further look into the properties of the largest value here for American Airlines Inc.  To do so, we can isolate the row corresponding to the arrival delay of 1539 minutes for American in our original `flights` dataset.


```{r max_props}
flights %>% filter(arr_delay == 1539, 
                  carrier_name == "American Airlines Inc.") %>%
  select(-c(month, day, carrier, dest_name, hour, 
            minute, carrier_name, arr_delay))
```

We see that the flight occurred on March 3rd and departed a little after 2 PM on its way to Dallas/Fort Worth.  Lastly, we show how we can visualize the arrival delay of all departing flights from Portland on March 3rd against time of departure.

```{r march3plot, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
flights %>% filter(month == 3, day == 3) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dep_time, y = arr_delay)) + geom_point()
```

## Introduction
Drought a complex and poorly understood natural hazard that simultaneously affects many economic sectors and people (Wilhite 2000).  Changing climatic conditions and increases in extreme climate events have resulted in increased concern about drought frequency, severity, and duration (Peterson et al. 2013). Drought can be defined as the extreme persistence of precipitation deficit over a specific region for a specific period  (Zargar et al. 2011).  However, a single definition of drought is not possible because drought effects vary geographically, temporally, and by economic and environmental sectors impacted by a reduction in the water supply (Heim 2002).  Different drought types are defined based on the system of interest with operational definitions used for parts of the hydrologic cycle that experience drought and conceptual definitions used for societal or ecological systems that depend on a water supply for which factors outside of the physical nature of drought exist (Tsakiris and Vangelis 2005).

Drought impacts available water supply to economic and social sectors, and ecosystems. Socioeconomic drought occurs when water demand is greater than water supply and results from increased water demand by growing populations or economic sector development, over-allocation among competing beneficial uses, or non-sustainable groundwater use (Frick et al. 1990; Heim 2002; Svoboda and Fuchs 2016).  Socioeconomic drought magnitudes have increased in recent years as a result of the narrowing of the gap between water supply and water demand (Hayes et al. 2011).  Ecological drought is defined as a “shortage of water causing stress on ecosystems, adversely affecting the life of plants and animals” (Lake 2011). Unlike other forms of drought, ecological drought does not currently have specific indices to quantify it (Lake 2011; Svoboda et al. n.d.). The impacts of these types of drought depend on the magnitude of the water shortage, as well as the vulnerability of a socioeconomic sector or ecosystem to a reduction in the water supply (Zargar et al. 2011).

Meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological drought are operationally defined by duration, magnitude, geographic extent, and frequency, as well as by drought impacts, indicators, and indices 
(Wilhite and Glantz 1985; Wilhite et al. 2014; Zargar et al. 2011). Indicators are used in combination to simplify complex interrelationships these parameters to derive a drought index.  A drought index is a numerical standard based on water-balance or hydrological models and professional judgment (i.e., the US Drought Index) (Svoboda et al. 2015). A drought index objectively compares cumulative effects of a prolonged and abnormal moisture deficiency and recurrence probability from region to region and historical drought to current conditions (Heim 2002; Svoboda and Fuchs 2016; Zargar et al. 2011).

Communication of climate anomalies using drought indices can facilitate the planning the development of water resources as part of drought risk management (Wilhite 2000).  Duration is the length of a drought, usually of a minimum of two to three months to become established and continuing for months to years. Magnitude is the accumulated deficit of water (e.g., precipitation, soil moisture, or runoff) below some threshold during a drought period. Drought impact magnitude of drought impacts is closely related to the timing of the onset of the precipitation shortage, its intensity, and the duration of the event.  Intensity is the ratio of drought magnitude to duration (Zargar et al. 2011).  The degree of a precipitation shortfall and the severity of associated impacts, often measured by a departure from expected or average normal precipitation for a period ranging from one to twelve or more months.  Drought intensity and duration determine the extent of drought impact (Wilhite 2000).  Geographic extent is the areal coverage of the drought which is variable during the event (Zargar et al. 2011).  Drought frequency or average return period is defined as the average time between drought events that have a severity that is equal to or greater than a threshold (Zargar et al. 2011).  Drought impacts are defined as an observable loss or change at a specific time because of drought.  Along with precipitation deficit, drought indicators are combinations of climate parameters: evapotranspiration, temperature, streamflow, groundwater and reservoir levels, soil moisture and snowpack (Svoboda and Fuchs 2016). 

Meteorological drought is an extended precipitation deficit over an extended period between the actual depth of precipitation received and the expected precipitation depth (Heim 2002).  Meteorological drought, which can develop quickly and end abruptly, leads to other types of drought.  Agricultural drought can rapidly follow a meteorological drought, particularly during a period of high temperatures and windy conditions (Heim 2002; Wilhite 2000).  Agricultural drought, defined by sustained soil moisture deficits, leads to low recharge from the soil to surface and ground waters and may result in hydrological drought.  

Agricultural drought “is typically defined as a period when soil moisture is inadequate to meet evapotranspiration demands to initiate and sustain crop growth” (Changnon 1987).  Soil moisture availability is the difference between actual and potential evapotranspiration (Tate and Gustard 2000). The potential evapotranspiration (PET) equals the actual evapotranspiration (AET) when an adequate supply of moisture in the soil is available to meet vegetation moisture demands. Otherwise, the actual evapotranspiration is less than the potential evapotranspiration.  While solar radiation is the dominant factor for evapotranspiration, direct measurements of solar radiation are often unavailable; and mean daily temperature, latitude, and time of year are used to approximate PET.   Soil infiltration rates, soil moisture capacity, and the magnitude and timing of precipitation (Heim 2002; Lake 2011).  Wilhite (2000) suggests an operational definition of agricultural drought by comparing precipitation to AET to determine the rate of soil water depletion, then expressing the relationship on soil moisture effects on plant development.  

Hydrological drought emphasizes interactions between the natural characteristics of meteorological drought and the human activities that depend on precipitation to provide adequate water supplies to meet societal and environmental demands (Wilhite et al. 2014). Hydrological drought is  “a period of abnormally dry weather sufficiently prolonged for the lack of precipitation to cause a serious hydrological imbalance” (AMS Council 2013).  A hydrological drought has two components: surface water drought and groundwater drought, “with the latter lagging well behind surface water drought in both commencing and finishing” (Bond et al. 2008). 

Hydrological drought determination is based on the effects of the precipitation shortfall on the surface or subsurface water supply, rather than the magnitude of the precipitation deficiency (Dracup et al. 1980; Wilhite 2000).  Antecedent soil moisture and aquifer conditions, hot temperatures, low relative humidity, and desiccating winds are other factors that may result in agricultural and hydrological droughts following a short-term absence of precipitation (Heim 2002). Because time elapses before precipitation deficiencies become evident as reduced streamflow, reservoir, and groundwater levels, hydrological drought, is often out of phase with the occurrence of meteorological and agricultural drought.  A hydrological drought may continue for months or years beyond the termination of other drought types because of the long time needed to recharge reservoirs or groundwater (Wilhite 2000). 

Hydrological drought designation is often based on streamflow (Heim 2002) because streamflow integrates hydrologic processes at the watershed level. Streamflow at the watershed level includes direct runoff from the ground surface to a channel, interflow of water into the stream channel from saturated soils, and base runoff from groundwater outflow.  Reduced stream flows in upstream segments of a basin may result in lower reservoir and groundwater levels at downstream locations, even though meteorological drought does not extend to lower portions.  Reduced streamflow impacts public water supply, hydroelectric power production, recreation, transportation, and agriculture, leading to conflicts between upstream and downstream water users (Wilhite 2000).  

Quantification of hydrologic drought impacts are further complicated by multiple and often competing hydrological storage system usages such as irrigation, recreation, tourism, flood control, hydroelectric power production, domestic water supply, protection of endangered species, and ecosystem preservation.  Timing between meteorological drought and hydrological drought depends on watershed storage and recharge rates.  Recovery from a hydrologic drought recovery lags the return to normal meteorological conditions with a length of the lag related to the groundwater recharge rate that varies with watershed geology and vertical connectivity (Wilhite et al. 2014). 

Ecological drought is defined as a shortage of water causing stress on ecosystems, adversely affecting the life of plants and animals (Lake 2011). Drought stress is a ramp disturbance that steadily builds in strength and spatial extent as water availability declines (Humphries and Baldwin 2003).   While hydrology fundamentally influences ecosystem dynamics, life history strategies, and diversity patterns in streams (Schriever et al. 2015), water workers have only recently identified ecological drought as a disturbance. Stream channel water levels (e.g., stream stage) drops during a hydrologic drought leading to a weakening of lateral connectivity as water recedes from the riparian and littoral zones and backwaters (Boulton, 2003). Hydrological drought results in a stage reduction caused by decreased lateral connectivity as waters recede from the riparian and littoral zones and backwaters, and groundwater flow.  Flow reduction causes several abiotic changes including reduced organic C, N, and P inputs from the riparian zone, higher water temperatures caused by reduced riparian shading, high air temperatures, increased salinity, alkalinity, pH, Mg/Ca ratios, hypoxic conditions, and decreased water clarity.  A stream may become intermittent later in a hydrologic drought, and in streams with high particulate organic matter concentrations "blackwater conditions" can increase turbidity (Lake 2011; Russell and Johnson 2007).  The abiotic effects of hydrological drought often result in stream ecosystem changes, including increases in filamentous algae and decreased heterotrophic production.  The ecologic response depends on the magnitude of the precipitation drought, streamflow permanence, and ecosystem resiliency (Bonada et al. 2007; Bond et al. 2008; Humphries and Baldwin 2003; Resh et al. 2013).  Several authors have distinguished predictable seasonal drought, allowing for evolutionary or life history adaptations to dry periods, from an unpredictable supra-seasonal drought that can result in abrupt long-term changes in community structure (Boersma et al. 2014; Bogan et al. 2013; Humphries:2003tna Lake 2011).  

States and Tribal entities are required under the federal Clean Water Act to develop standards for their waters to ensure the protection of beneficial uses protected. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) consults on a government‐to‐government basis with federally recognized tribes under the EPA Policy on Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribes (US Environmental Protection Agency 1995).  As discussed above, the study area is the Pine Ridge reservation and is under the jurisdiction of the Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST).  The OST currently follows South Dakota surface water quality standards for waters of the Pine Ridge Reservation (SD Dept Environment and Natural Resources 2017) for beneficial uses including Warm and Cold Water Permanent and Semi-Permanent Fisheries, Immersion Recreation, Stock Watering.  States and Tribal Entities are required by the US EPA to adopt either narrative or numeric criteria to maintain or restore biological integrity in waters under their jurisdiction (US Environmental Protection Agency 1995). Biological integrity is defined to mean “the capability of supporting and maintaining a balanced, integrated, and adaptive community of organisms having a composition and diversity comparable to that of natural habitats of the region” (US Environmental Protection Agency 2011). 

The US EPA recommends a multiple-stressor approach to identify key stressors (disturbances) and primarily taxa-based metrics such as taxa-richness,  dominance, the percentage of pollution-sensitive taxa, and percentage of pollution-tolerant taxa (Karr 1999).   "A perturbation consists of two parts: the disturbance, and the biotic responses to the disturbance" (Lake 2003).  Stressors (Bunn and Arthington 2002; Poff and Zimmerman 2010), can be naturally occurring (floods, droughts, earthquakes, fires) and human-caused (increased nutrient or sediment loading, human-induced changes in riparian or channel structure.  The OST has designated a Spiritual Use for surface waters under Tribal jurisdiction.  The Tribe has not identified criteria for the Spiritual Use designation; however, Tribal Resource Agencies indicate their interest in developing standards-based criteria describing the desired biological condition of aquatic communities.

Literature Review
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommends the use of drought indices for measuring meteorological, agricultural and hydrologic drought magnitudes (Hayes et al. 2011).  The recommended drought indices are the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for meteorological drought, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), another soil moisture or water balance index, or the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for agricultural drought.  The WMO discussed the potential for use of the streamflow drought index (SDI) but did not come to a consensus on a single hydrological drought index.  The WMO has not developed recommendations for ecological drought.

Drought monitoring in regions where drought occurs mainly because of precipitation variability is well-represented by SPI because the index measures the total precipitation deviation from normal over a monthly or longer averaging period (Fiorillo and Guadagno 2009; Khan et al. 2008; Vicente-Serrano and López-Moreno 2005). SPI has a solid theoretical development, is robust to missing data, and is characteristic of a moving process (Guttman 1999; Heim 2002; Redmond 2002; Svoboda and Fuchs 2016).  SPI index values are normally distributed, uniquely related to the probability of occurrence and can be used to calculate a running precipitation deficit to indicate drought duration and intensity (Tsakiris et al. 2006).  Since SPI is normalized, it is comparable across wetter and drier locations, time periods and scales (Tigkas et al. 2014; Vicente-Serrano et al. 2012).  Different drought types can be identified by SPI, which is a valuable property of the index because hydrologic systems (i.e., precipitation, soil moisture, streamflow), and regions (i.e., headwaters, valley fill, karstic) can respond to drought conditions at different time scales (Vicente-Serrano and López-Moreno 2005).  Heim (2002), and Svoboda and Fuchs (2016) suggest the following time-steps for SPI calculations for different drought types: one to three months correspond with meteorological drought, three to six months correspond with agricultural drought, and time steps of twelve months or longer correspond with hydrological drought.  The SPI requires 20 to 30 years of time series data with additional years of data having more extreme wet and extreme dry observations resulting in more robust results (Guttman 1999; Svoboda and Fuchs 2016).

The SPI is a dimensionless index that relates dry and wet periods to frequency and duration. SPI transforms a long-term precipitation record to standardized series with an average of zero and a standard deviation of unity.  More negative numbers indicate high intensity and less probable dry events, and, correspondingly,  more positive numbers indicate high intensity and less probable wet events (Svoboda and Fuchs 2016). I provide the mathematical basis for SPI following Vicente-Serrano’s description fitting observations to the Pearson III distribution (Vicente-Serrano 2006).  McKee's (1993) original method used a two-parameter gamma distribution with parameters estimated by the maximum likelihood method; however, Guttman (1999) found Pearson III distribution provides the better goodness of fit. The probability density function for a Pearson III distributed variable is expressed as:
f(x)=1/αΓ(β)  ((x-γ)/α)^(β-1) e^(-((x-γ)/α) )
where α, β and γ are the shape, scale and origin parameters, respectively, for precipitation values x > 0; and (β) is the Gamma function of β. The Pearson III distribution parameters are obtained from L-moment ratios.  The first L-moment ratio, τ2 = λ2/λ1 is analogous to the coefficient of variation, and the second and third L-moment ratios, τ3 = λ3/λ2 and τ4 = λ4/λ2 are analogous to coefficients of skewness and kurtosis, respectively (Hosking 1990). L- moments are linear combinations of probability weighted moments (PWM), which can be calculated using the formulae: 
λ1 = α0(
λ2 = α0 − 2α1(
λ3 = α0 −6α1 +6α2
λ4 = α0 −12α1 +30α2 −20α3 
so PWM of order s is calculated using: 
a_s=1/N ∑_(i=1)^N▒(〖1-F〗_i )^s  x_i;       F_i=(i-0.35)/N
where xi is the data from a given precipitation series, Fi is the frequency estimator, i is the range of observations arranged in rising order, and N is the number of data points (Vicente-Serrano 2006)
If τ3 ≥ 1/3, then τm = 1 − τ3 and β can be obtained using the formula: 
β=  ((0.36067 τ_m  - 〖0.5967τ_m〗^2  + 0.25361〖τ_m〗^3 ))/(1 - 2.78861τ_m  + 2.56096〖τ_m〗^2  - 0.77045〖τ_m〗^3  )
If τ3 < 1/3, then τm = 3π τ32and β can be obtained using the following expression: 
β=  ((1+0.2906 τ_m ))/(τ_m  + 0.1882〖τ_m〗^2  - 0.0442〖τ_m〗^3  )
a=√(π ) λ_2  (Γ(β))/(Γ(β + 1/2) )
γ = λ_1-αβ
The probability distribution function of x given by and are calculated analytically: 
F(x)=1/(αΓ(β)) ∫_y^x▒〖((x-γ)/α)^(β-1) e^(-((x-γ)/α) ) 〗
Pearson III distribution is not defined for x = 0; however, precipitation series may include months in which there is no precipitation. An adapted statistic H(x) can be calculated using the following formula: 
H(x) = q + (1 - q)F(x) 
where q is the probability of zero precipitation and is calculated as m/n, where n is the total number of months and m is the number of months with no precipitation. The cumulative probability H(x), is then transformed to the standard normal random variable z with mean zero and variance of one.  Fortunately, SPI can be calculated using either a stand-alone package available through the University of Lincoln Drought Mitigation Center webpage (Svoboda and Fuchs 2016) or using the SPEI package (Beguería and Vicente-Serrano 2017) in the R statistical programming language (R Core Team 2018).
McKee et al. (1993) state that drought begins at an SPI of zero or less; however, some researchers choose a drought threshold that is less than zero, but not quite −1 (Svoboda and Fuchs 2016).  The drought event continues until SPI reaches a value greater than zero.  A potential weakness of the SPI is that the index by itself may not account for a particular region's overall water balance and water use if different temperatures occur for similar SPI values (Svoboda and Fuchs 2016).  Drought magnitude is the positive sum of the SPI for each month during the drought event (Hayes et al. 2007).   A composite table of narrative drought classes is shown below with DI (drought index) indicating SPI (meteorological drought), SPEI (soil moisture drought), and SDI (hydrological drought) (Lloyd-Hughes 2002; Tigkas et al. 2014)

The Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI) is the preferred index for the overall water balance and water use of a region, in which temperature variation is non-stationary, or potential evapotranspiration (PET) is non-negligible (Svoboda and Fuchs 2016).  The SPEI represents departures in the difference between water availability and the atmospheric water demand, the "climate water balance."  SPEI has been shown to be more effective than SPI in correlating streamflow deficits, reservoir storage, and water demand, and therefore, is assumed to provide a reasonable estimate of soil moisture(Lorenzo-Lacruz et al. 2010; Svoboda and Fuchs 2016). A potential weakness of the SPEI is that the index requires a serially complete dataset for both temperature and precipitation (Svoboda and Fuchs 2016).  The SPEI algorithm calculates effective precipitation by subtracting PET from precipitation, with PET estimated by the Thornwaite (Thornthwaite 1948), Penman-Monteith (PM) (Walter et al. 2000), or Hargreaves equation (Droogers and Allen 2002; Hargreaves and Samani 1985). 
The SPEI is mathematically similar to SPI, except that the input for the index is effective precipitation (Beguería et al. 2013; Svoboda and Fuchs 2016); and a log-logistic distribution provides the better goodness of fit than the gamma distribution in the estimation of SPEI values (Vicente-Serrano et al. 2010a).  I provide below the mathematical basis for SPI following Beguería et al. (2014); Vicente-Serrano et al. (2010a, 2010b, 2011, 2012) provide a complete description of the theory behind the SPEI, the computational details, and comparisons of SPEI with other drought indicators. The probability distribution function of a variable D according to a log-logistic distribution is given by:
F(D)=[1+(α/(D-γ))^β ]^(-1)
where andrepresent the scale, shape, and location parameters that are estimated from the sample D, which is the difference between precipitation and PET.  An unbiased plotting estimator based on probability-weighted moments (Hosking 1986) is the default plotting position method implemented in the SPEI package in R as: 
w_s=1/N ∑_(i=1)^N▒((□((N-i)/s)) D_i)/□((N-i)/s)

Nalbantis and Tsakiris (Nalbantis and Tsakiris 2009) derived the standardized streamflow index (SDI) from the SPI to identify hydrologic drought. The SDI uses monthly streamflow values and the methods of normalization associated with SPI for developing a drought index based upon streamflow data (Svoboda and Fuchs 2016).  However, it may be difficult to select the most appropriate distribution to calculate a streamflow drought index over a wide area because topography, lithology, vegetation, and human management may increase flow variability within a basin and change statistical properties of downstream reaches, (Vicente-Serrano et al. 2012).

Nalbantis and Tsakiris (2008) defined the Streamflow Drought Index (SDI) is a hydrological drought index with properties identical to the SPI. I provide the mathematical basis for SPI following Tigkas (2014).  The cumulative streamflow volume Vi k is calculated from the equation: 
V_(i,k)=∑_(j=1)^3k▒Q_(i,j)    i=1,2,⋯;  j=1,2,⋯12,k=1,2,3,4
for monthly streamflow volumes Qi j, in which i denotes the hydrological year, j the month within that hydrological year (j = 1 for October and j = 12 for September), and k the reference period, k = 1 for October-December, k = 2 for October-March, k = 3 for October-June, and k = 4 for October-September.  The Streamflow Drought Index (SDI) is defined for each reference period k of the i-th hydrological year based on the cumulative streamflow volumes Vi,k by:
〖SDI〗_(i,k)=  (V_(i,k)-V ̅_k)/s_k ,   i=1,2,⋯;   k=1,2,3,4
in which Vk and sk are the mean and the standard deviation of cumulative streamflow volumes of the reference period k.  The resulting index is equal to the standardized streamflow volume.  To reduce skewness and because streamflow tends to be well-approximated by a Gamma distribution, Nalbantis and Tsarkaris recommend logarithmic transformation of streamflow volume is before SDI calculation such that  
〖SDI〗_(i,k)=  (y_(i,k)-y ̅_k)/s_(y,k) ,   i=1,2,⋯;   k=1,2,3,4
where
y_k=lna(V_(i,k) ),   i=1,2,⋯;   k=1,2,3,4

Streams are increasingly understood as the central agent at the interface of the co-evolution of climate, geology, topography and ecology and their transient and long-term responses to change (Hrachowitz et al. 2014; Thorp 2014).  Hydrological systems respond differently at various time scales because of lithologic and geometric watershed differences (Lopez-Moreno et al. 2013).  Effective prediction of streamflow responses to drought is increasingly understood in managing for sustainable water supply (Vörösmarty et al. 2000) and water quality (Kundzewicz et al. 2008).  
Hydrology fundamentally influences ecosystem dynamics, life history strategies, and diversity patterns in streams (Belmar et al. 2013; Bonada et al. 2007; Gallart et al. 2012; Ledger et al. 2013a; Lytle and Poff 2016; Olden and Poff 2003).  Differences in streamflow dynamics result in strong habitat-filters favoring taxa adapted to particular hydrological extremes as well as habitat generalists capable of persisting in a variety of habitats (Schriever et al. 2015). Ecological community composition can remain stable for a long time and rapidly transition into an alternative stable state (Bogan and Lytle 2011; Bogan et al. 2015; Yodzis 1989). Hydrologic drought results in a progressive habitat loss, depletion of food resources, and increased predation and interspecific competition that puts aquatic biota under stress (Bond et al. 2008). 

Stream biota exhibit a variable response to seasonal and supra-seasonal drought; tending to exhibit high resistance to seasonal drought, and low resistance and variable resilience to supra-seasonal drought (Boersma et al. 2014; Bogan et al. 2015).  Native biota in drought-prone systems has evolved resistance or resilience traits that allow them to survive predictable drought (Boersma et al. 2014; Lytle and Poff 2016; Robinson et al. 1992; Stanley et al. 1994; Stubbington et al. 2016), including flow cessation resulting in >95% habitat contraction (Bogan and Lytle 2007).  Biota with resistance traits to ‘sit out the drought' either possess desiccation resistant life-history stages or utilize ‘refugia,' habitats that offer less harsh conditions in an otherwise drought-affected environment (Adams and Warren 2005; Arthington et al. 2005; Bond et al. 2008; Stubbington 2012).  Biota with resilience traits have mechanisms allowing widespread and rapid dispersal among suitable habitat patches (Bond et al. 2008; Boulton 2003; Fritz and Dodds 2004; Humphries and Baldwin 2003). Community recovery, particularly in perennial streams, tends to be rapid following seasonal drought, with resilience mechanisms responsible for a greater portion of recovery (Datry et al. 2014).  However, supra-seasonal drought may cause stream intermittency and community turnover in which short-lived (<1 year) strong dispersers replace relatively long-lived (≥1 year) weak dispersers.  The regime shift may delay or preclude recovery to pre-drought conditions, and potential for community recovery from extreme drought decreases with greater drought magnitude and duration, hydrologic connectivity, and proximity to drought refuges (Bogan et al. 2015; Robson et al. 2011). 

A literature review returned some prior work on stream community alteration and recovery from drought in Great Plains streams.  Dodds (2004) summarized macroinvertebrate recovery in the Great Plains following drought.  He found community composition immediately following a drought is dominated by taxa with drought-resistant traits with a general colonization sequence reflecting life-cycle length.  Initial recruitment following a drought is made up of upper-reach drift of resistant taxa plus resilient taxa, such as chironomid midges, with high growth and reproduction rates that aerially colonize stream reaches.   Larger invertebrates with slower lifecycles, stoneflies and caddisflies, tend to arrive one to two months post-drought (Dodds et al. 2004).

Miller and Golladay (1996) investigated effects of seasonal drought the macroinvertebrate community in an intermittent stream in southeastern Oklahoma.  Invertebrate density in pools doubled during a gradual five-month summer drying event and increased six-fold during a spring drying event.  The density increase was dominated by biting midges (ceratopogonids) and nonbiting midges (chironomids) and aquatic worms (oligochaetes) during both drying events.  Small squaregill mayfly (caenids), which were the major taxon in riffles, density in pools increased during the spring drying event, but did not increase during the summer drying event. Post-drought recovery in riffles was first dominated by black flies (simuliids), until three-months later when rolled-winged stoneflies (leuctrids) became the most dominant taxon.  Water scavenger (hydrophilid) beetle density did not substantially change during drought (Miller and Golladay 1996).
Research in semi-arid regions outside the Great Plains (Bêche et al. 2009; Bogan et al. 2015; Pace et al. 2013), arid regions (Sponseller et al. 2010), and mesocosms (Ledger et al. 2013a; b) provides other analogs for Pine Ridge reservation stream community alteration and recovery from drought.  Resh, Bêche, and others (2013) provide general description of the effects of drought stress in their synthesis of community change in Mediterranean-climate streams in California. They found severe drought resulted in macroinvertebrate community shifts, and rapid changes in age-structure from multi-cohort to single-cohort that recovered slowly (~10 years).  Bogan and Lytle (2011) found temperature and pool area, and conductivity accounted for nearly 90% of variance as a stream shifted from perennial to intermittent during a supraseasonal drought.  Pre-drought conditions were characterized by a diverse low-resilience and long-lived community of skimmer dragonflies (libellulids), giant water bugs (belostomatids), broad-shouldered water striders (veliids), and beetles (coleopterans: dryopids, dytiscids, haliplids).  The post supra-seasonal drought community was equally diverse.  However, short-lived vagrile taxa characterized the post-drought community of baetids, veliids, water striders (gerrids), diving water beetles (dytiscids), and minute moss-beetles (hydraenids) (Bogan and Lytle 2011).
Bêche and others (2009) used indicator species analysis to characterize successional communities pre-drought and following a supra-seasonal (1.3% recurrence interval) drought.  They found the dominant taxa for the pre-drought period included northern and mortar-joint casemaker caddisflies (limnephilids and odontocerids), creeping water beetles (naucorids), and stratiomyids.  Post-drought dominant early successional taxa included hydroptilids, and stratiomyids followed by mid-successional dytiscids, hydrophilids, and sandflies (ceratopogonid), and late-successional comb-mouthed mayflies (ameletids), baetids, and green stoneflies (chloroperlids) became dominant in late succession.  Crane flies (tipulids) were drought indicators in all successional stages.  They concluded there was no evidence of a complete post-drought community recovery following the supra-seasonal drought (Bêche et al. 2009)
Pace and others (2013) studied the drought response of mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies, collectively (EPT) in wet- and dry- Mediterranean climate streams in a Catalonia, Spain between 1995-2008.  They found the EPT compositional shifts from drought were less extensive in the wet mesoclimate streams that experienced a less-severe drought and had greater baseflow.  The EPT community in wet mesoclimate streams shifted from a pre-drought community of prong-gilled mayflies (leptophlebiids), chloroperlids, and nemourids to a post-drought community of baetids, stripetail stoneflies (perlodids), and saddle casemaker (glossosomatid), limnephilid and bushtailed (sericostomatid) caddisflies.  The EPT community in dry mesoclimate streams shifted from a pre-drought community of flat-headed mayflies (heptageniids) and hydropsychids to a post-drought community of baetids, limnephiloids, hydropsychids, and net-tube caddisflies (psychomyiids)

Bogan, Boersma and others (2014, 2015) identified drought-intolerant and drought-tolerant taxa. The seasonal-drought intolerant taxa included small minnow (baetid) mayflies, small winter (capniid) and spring (nemourid) stoneflies, net-spinning (hydropsychid) caddisflies, riffle (elmid) and water-penny (psephenid) beetles, and naucorids. Seasonal drought-adapted (e.g., resistant) taxa included calamoceratid caddisflies, diving beetles (dytiscids), giant water bugs (belostomatids), true flies (dipterans; including ceratopogonids, chironomids, corydalids, simuliids, stratiomyids and tabanids), and non-insects (copepods, amphipods, and mites).  Instream colonizers included primitive-minnow (siphlonurid) mayflies, tube-case (limnephilid) caddisflies, capniids, net-winged midges (blepharicerids). Drought-resilient early-areal colonizers following seasonal drought including backswimmer and water-boatman (notonectid and corixid) water bugs, and diving and water scavenger (dytiscid and hydrophilid) beetles.  Drought-resilient late-areal colonizers included hydroptilids, spread-winged damselflies (lestids), and drain flies (psychodids).

Bogan and others (2015) describe macroinvertebrate community trajectories following extreme supra-seasonal droughts as having little effect on aquatic invertebrate taxon richness, but significantly altering community composition from a pre-drying community dominated by relatively large, long-lived and sedentary taxa to smaller, shorter-lived and highly vagile taxa, including strong aerial dispersers post-drought.  They documented an eight-year (2001-2009) community transition in an ecologically isolated series of travertine (limestone springs) pools in south-eastern Arizona. The pre-drought community was diverse and characterized by long-lived, poor-dispersing, taxa made up of large-sized water bugs, libellulids, calamoceratid caddisflies; and mid-sized veliids, whirligig and creeping water beetles (gyrinids and halipids).  The mid-drought community was dominated by mosquito larvae (culicids).  The post-drought community was characterized by hydrophilids, dytiscids, and veliids. Three common species and three uncommon species were extirpated from the post-drought community (Bogan and Lytle 2011), potentially as a result of  low resilience (e.g. low dispersal from refugea) (Phillipsen et al. 2015). 
Bogan and others (2015) synthesized findings from geographically separated semi-arid harshly intermittent desert mountain streams to update a conceptual model of post-drought recovery trajectories developed by Boulton (2003) to include seasonal vs. supra-seasonal drought.   The model predicts that low isolation streams following a predictable, mild seasonal drought should exhibit high species richness as lotic and lentic taxa ‘time-share' between wet and dry season.  Highly isolated streams following a low severity drought should exhibit reduced species richness as weak dispersers experience stochastic extirpations.  As some sensitive taxa and weak dispersers disappear in moderately isolated streams following a moderate severity drought should experience reduced species richness.  Non-isolated streams following a high severity drought should experience reduced species richness as populations of resistant taxa recover and colonists from nearby refuges return.  Highly isolated streams experiencing a severe drought should experience substantial reductions in species as only the most resistant taxa remain (Bogan et al. 2015).  
Storey (2016) investigated macroinvertebrate community compositional differences drought in forested and pasture-land intermittent streams in New Zealand. Perennial forested streams were dominated by leptophlebiid and coloburiscid mayflies, Stony-cased (pycnocentrod) and conoesucid caddisflies, and elmids, with lesser abundances of chironomids, and austroperlid and gripopterygid stoneflies.  Perennial pastureland streams were similar to perennial forested streams with the addition of higher abundances of hydroptilids.  In contrast, forested and pastureland intermittent streams were dominated by gastropods, chironomids, simuliids, and oligachaetes, with lesser abundances of leptophbiid mayflies, polycentropodid caddisflies, ostracod and cladoceran shrimps.  Oligochaetes, chironomids, and nematodes increased during dry years, while mayflies, caddisflies and beetles decreased in intermittent streams, with ‘weeks of no flow’ as the strongest predictor variable.
Sponseller and others (2010) studied macroinvertebrate community recovery following spring floods from 1983–1999; including a supra-seasonal 1989-1990 drought in an intermittent desert stream in Arizona and found antecedent flow conditions were the best predictor of macroinvertebrate community structural changes.  They found baetid, snail-case caddisfly (helicopsychid), tipulid, and stratiomyid abundance decreased following drought and recovered during wet periods (e.g., drought resilience).  Hydropsychids, which were abundant before a supra-seasonal drought, were extirpated.  Gastropod and ceratopogonid abundance increased during drought, most likely because of their tolerance to increased water temperature and corresponding hypoxic conditions.  The early colonizers (e.g. r-selected taxa), chironomids and ceratopogonids, were dominant in early post-drought successional stages but were replaced in dominance in later successional phases by more slowly-growing hydropsychids, helicopsychids, and gastropods.

Ledger and others simulated the effect prolonged drought on the structure and functioning of complex food webs with a two-year experiment using stream mesocosms (Ledger et al. 2013b; a).  The results of their experimental study are consistent with the results of field studies summarized above: drought triggered losses of species, especially engulfing macropredators and changes in trophic interactions resulting from top-down food web erosion leading to their partial collapse.  The recurrent drying disturbances resulted in a macroinvertebrate community shift to transient communities dominated by relatively few, r-selected (e.g., multivoltine) and smaller-bodied species (>50% decline in secondary production), and functional feeding group increases in gastropod grazers. Compensatory dynamics sustained total macroinvertebrate densities (e.g., count per sampling effort), in part through increased amorphous detritus fluxes to chironomids. Ledger and others found no evidence that drought promoted trophic generalists over specialists through indirect effects on food supply.  Instead, drought increased physiological stress, with large-bodied species being most strongly affected, directly increasing consumer mortality.  Similar regime shifts following a supra-seasonal drought were reported in a UK chalk stream.  The drought reduced taxa richness and abundance, particularly baetids, ephemerellids, small squaregill mayflies (caenids) hydropsychids, sericostomatids and leptocerids (Stubbington et al. 2009).

## Math

\TeX\ is the best way to typeset mathematics. Donald Knuth designed \TeX\ when he got frustrated at how long it was taking the typesetters to finish his book, which contained a lot of mathematics.  One nice feature of _R Markdown_ is its ability to read LaTeX code directly.

If you are doing a thesis that will involve lots of math, you will want to read the following section which has been commented out. If you're not going to use math, skip over or delete this next commented section.

From Informational Dynamics, we have the following (Dave Braden):

After _n_ such encounters the posterior density for $\theta$ is

$$
\pi(\theta|X_1< y_1,\dots,X_n<y_n) \varpropto \pi(\theta) \prod_{i=1}^n\int_{-\infty}^{y_i}
   \exp\left(-{(x-\theta)^2\over{2\sigma^2}}\right)\ dx

## Chemistry 101: Symbols

Chemical formulas will look best if they are not italicized. Get around math mode's automatic italicizing in LaTeX by using the argument `$\mathrm{formula here}$`, with your formula inside the curly brackets.  (Notice the use of the backticks here which enclose text that acts as code.)

So, $\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}Cr_2O_4}$ is written `$\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}Cr_2O_4}$`.

<!--
The \noindent command below does what you'd expect:  it forces the current line/paragraph to not indent. This was done here to match the format of the LaTeX thesis PDF.
-->

\noindent Exponent or Superscript: $\mathrm{O^-}$

\noindent Subscript: $\mathrm{CH_4}$

To stack numbers or letters as in $\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}}$, the subscript is defined first, and then the superscript is defined.

\noindent Bullet: CuCl $\bullet$ $\mathrm{7H_{2}O}$


\noindent Delta: $\Delta$

\noindent Reaction Arrows: $\longrightarrow$ or  $\xrightarrow{solution}$

\noindent Resonance Arrows: $\leftrightarrow$

\noindent Reversible Reaction Arrows: $\rightleftharpoons$

### Typesetting reactions

You may wish to put your reaction in an equation environment, which means that LaTeX will place the reaction where it fits and will number the equations for you. 

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{C_6H_{12}O_6  + 6O_2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{6CO_2 + 6H_2O}
  (\#eq:reaction)
\end{equation}

We can reference this combustion of glucose reaction via Equation \@ref(eq:reaction).

### Other examples of reactions

$\mathrm{NH_4Cl_{(s)}}$ $\rightleftharpoons$ $\mathrm{NH_{3(g)}+HCl_{(g)}}$

\noindent $\mathrm{MeCH_2Br + Mg}$ $\xrightarrow[below]{above}$ $\mathrm{MeCH_2\bullet Mg \bullet Br}$

# Tables, Graphics, References, and Labels {#ref-labels}

## Tables

In addition to the tables that can be automatically generated from a data frame in **R** that you saw in [R Markdown Basics] using the `kable` function, you can also create tables using _pandoc_. (More information is available at <http://pandoc.org/README.html#tables>.)  This might be useful if you don't have values specifically stored in **R**, but you'd like to display them in table form.  Below is an example.  Pay careful attention to the alignment in the table and hyphens to create the rows and columns.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Factors                    Correlation between Parents & Child      Inherited
------------------------- ----------------------------------------- --------------
  Education                                -0.49                         Yes
  
  Socio-Economic Status                     0.28                        Slight   
  
  Income                                    0.08                          No
  
  Family Size                               0.18                        Slight
  
  Occupational Prestige                     0.21                        Slight
------------------------- ----------------------------------------- --------------
Table: (\#tab:inher) Correlation of Inheritance Factors for Parents and Child 

We can also create a link to the table by doing the following: Table \@ref(tab:inher).  If you go back to [Loading and exploring data] and look at the `kable` table, we can create a reference to this max delays table too: Table \@ref(tab:maxdelays). The addition of the `(\#tab:inher)` option to the end of the table caption allows us to then make a reference to Table `\@ref(tab:label)`. Note that this reference could appear anywhere throughout the document after the table has appeared.  

<!-- We will next explore ways to create this label-ref link using figures. -->

\clearpage

<!-- clearpage ends the page, and also dumps out all floats.
  Floats are things like tables and figures. -->


## Figures

If your thesis has a lot of figures, _R Markdown_ might behave better for you than that other word processor.  One perk is that it will automatically number the figures accordingly in each chapter.    You'll also be able to create a label for each figure, add a caption, and then reference the figure in a way similar to what we saw with tables earlier.  If you label your figures, you can move the figures around and _R Markdown_ will automatically adjust the numbering for you.  No need for you to remember!  So that you don't have to get too far into LaTeX to do this, a couple **R** functions have been created for you to assist.  You'll see their use below.

<!--
One thing that may be annoying is the way _R Markdown_ handles "floats" like tables and figures (it's really \LaTeX's fault). \LaTeX\ will try to find the best place to put your object based on the text around it and until you're really, truly done writing you should just leave it where it lies. There are some optional arguments specified in the options parameter of the `label` function.  If you need to shift your figure around, it might be good to look here on tweaking the options argument:  <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions>

If you need a graphic or tabular material to be part of the text, you can just put it inline. If you need it to appear in the list of figures or tables, it should be placed in a code chunk.
-->


In the **R** chunk below, we will load in a picture stored as `reed.jpg` in our main directory.  We then give it the caption of "Reed logo", the label of "reedlogo", and specify that this is a figure.  Make note of the different **R** chunk options that are given in the R Markdown file (not shown in the knitted document).

```{r reedlogo, fig.cap="Reed logo"}
include_graphics(path = "figure/reed.jpg")
```

Here is a reference to the Reed logo: Figure \@ref(fig:reedlogo).  Note the use of the `fig:` code here.  By naming the **R** chunk that contains the figure, we can then reference that figure later as done in the first sentence here.  We can also specify the caption for the figure via the R chunk option `fig.cap`.

\clearpage 

<!-- starts a new page and stops trying to place floats such as tables and figures -->

Below we will investigate how to save the output of an **R** plot and label it in a way similar to that done above.  Recall the `flights` dataset from Chapter \@ref(rmd-basics).  (Note that we've shown a different way to reference a section or chapter here.)  We will next explore a bar graph with the mean flight departure delays by airline from Portland for 2014.  Note also the use of the `scale` parameter which is discussed on the next page.

```{r delaysboxplot, warnings=FALSE, messages=FALSE, fig.cap="Mean Delays by Airline", fig.width=6}
flights %>% group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carrier, y = mean_dep_delay)) +
  geom_bar(position = "identity", stat = "identity", fill = "red")
```

Here is a reference to this image: Figure \@ref(fig:delaysboxplot).

A table linking these carrier codes to airline names is available at <https://github.com/ismayc/pnwflights14/blob/master/data/airlines.csv>.

\clearpage

Next, we will explore the use of the `out.extra` chunk option, which can be used to shrink or expand an image loaded from a file by specifying `"scale= "`. Here we use the mathematical graph stored in the "subdivision.pdf" file.

```{r subd, results="asis", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Subdiv. graph", out.extra="scale=0.75"}
include_graphics("figure/subdivision.pdf")
```

Here is a reference to this image: Figure \@ref(fig:subd).  Note that `echo=FALSE` is specified so that the **R** code is hidden in the document.

**More Figure Stuff**

Lastly, we will explore how to rotate and enlarge figures using the `out.extra` chunk option.  (Currently this only works in the PDF version of the book.)

```{r subd2, results="asis", echo=FALSE, out.extra="angle=180, scale=1.1", fig.cap="A Larger Figure, Flipped Upside Down"}
include_graphics("figure/subdivision.pdf")
```

As another example, here is a reference: Figure \@ref(fig:subd2).  

## Footnotes and Endnotes

You might want to footnote something. ^[footnote text] The footnote will be in a smaller font and placed appropriately. Endnotes work in much the same way. More information can be found about both on the CUS site or feel free to reach out to <data@reed.edu>.

## Bibliographies

Of course you will need to cite things, and you will probably accumulate an armful of sources. There are a variety of tools available for creating a bibliography database (stored with the .bib extension).  In addition to BibTeX suggested below, you may want to consider using the free and easy-to-use tool called Zotero.  The Reed librarians have created Zotero documentation at <http://libguides.reed.edu/citation/zotero>.  In addition, a tutorial is available from Middlebury College at <http://sites.middlebury.edu/zoteromiddlebury/>.

_R Markdown_ uses _pandoc_ (<http://pandoc.org/>) to build its bibliographies.  One nice caveat of this is that you won't have to do a second compile to load in references as standard LaTeX requires. To cite references in your thesis (after creating your bibliography database), place the reference name inside square brackets and precede it by the "at" symbol.  For example, here's a reference to a book about worrying:  [@Molina1994].  This `Molina1994` entry appears in a file called `thesis.bib` in the `bib` folder.  This bibliography database file was created by a program called BibTeX.  You can call this file something else if you like (look at the YAML header in the main .Rmd file) and, by default, is to placed in the `bib` folder.  

For more information about BibTeX and bibliographies, see our CUS site (<http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/index.html>)^[@reedweb2007]. There are three pages on this topic:  _bibtex_ (which talks about using BibTeX, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtex.html>), _bibtexstyles_ (about how to find and use the bibliography style that best suits your needs, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtexstyles.html>) and _bibman_ (which covers how to make and maintain a bibliography by hand, without BibTeX, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibman.html>). The last page will not be useful unless you have only a few sources.

If you look at the YAML header at the top of the main .Rmd file you can see that we can specify the style of the bibliography by referencing the appropriate csl file.  You can download a variety of different style files at <https://www.zotero.org/styles>.  Make sure to download the file into the csl folder.

**Tips for Bibliographies**

- Like with thesis formatting, the sooner you start compiling your bibliography for something as large as thesis, the better. Typing in source after source is mind-numbing enough; do you really want to do it for hours on end in late April? Think of it as procrastination.
- The cite key (a citation's label) needs to be unique from the other entries.
- When you have more than one author or editor, you need to separate each author's name by the word "and" e.g. `Author = {Noble, Sam and Youngberg, Jessica},`.
- Bibliographies made using BibTeX (whether manually or using a manager) accept LaTeX markup, so you can italicize and add symbols as necessary.
- To force capitalization in an article title or where all lowercase is generally used, bracket the capital letter in curly braces.
- You can add a Reed Thesis citation^[@noble2002] option. The best way to do this is to use the phdthesis type of citation, and use the optional "type" field to enter "Reed thesis" or "Undergraduate thesis." 

## Anything else?

If you'd like to see examples of other things in this template, please contact the Data @ Reed team (email <data@reed.edu>) with your suggestions. We love to see people using _R Markdown_ for their theses, and are happy to help.

# Conclusion {-}

If we don't want Conclusion to have a chapter number next to it, we can add the `{-}` attribute.

**More info**

And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter title or section head _shouldn't be_ indented, because indents are to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add an indent there.
