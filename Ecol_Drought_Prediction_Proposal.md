Introduction
========================================================

- Aquatic communities rely on streamflow
- Streamflow varies in time (e.g. floods, droughts) 
- Streamflow varies in space (geology, flow abstractions)

**Challenge:** "We understand how freshwater communities persist during normal and high flows better than we understand the ecological effects of droughts" - P.S. Lake

Biotic integrity has a signal to noise problem
========================================================
- We lack numeric approaches for ecosystem response to drought 
- Biotic integrity metrics **should** detect land use changes resulting in decreased habitat quality 
- However, drought affects also community composition:
+ *Predictible* seasonal drought -> **community resistance & 
resilience** 
+ *Unpredictable* supra-seasonal drought -> **regime shift**

Hypothesis & Project Design
========================================================
 
**Drought is a key driver of macroinvertebrate 
community regime shift for Northern Great Plains 
streams.** 

To validate and design solution, I plan to:

1. Quantify drought magnitudes for streams
2. Test effect of drought on invertebrate regime shift
3. Develop IBI metrics with robust invertebrates  
4. Update OST watershed protection plan with updated IBI metrics


How to define drought?
========================================================

- Drought is a persistent deficit in precipitation or 
water supply measured across space and time

Two general drought classes:

- **Operational drought**: Moisture deficit in one or more 
hydrologic cycle components. *Robust indices available*

- **Conceptual drought**: water supply deficits for 
society or ecosystems. *Objective measurements lacking*


Drought-type Hierarchy
========================================================
- **Meteorological drought**: Deficit between actual &
expected precipitation.  Leads to other drought types

-  **Agricultural drought**: Inadequate soil moisture 
to meet evapotranspiration & vegetation demands

- **Hydrological drought**:  Surface & ground water 
deficit lagging precipitation deficit & recovery 

- **Ecological drought** water shortage causing 
ecosystem stress & adversely to plants and animals by
flow reduction, higher water temps & salinity 


Drought Index Recomendations
========================================================

WMO recommends a drought index approach:

- **Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)** for   
meteorological drought
 
-  **Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)**
for soil moisture drought

- **Streamflow drought index (SDI)** discussed for 
hydrological drought  

- **No WMO recommendations** for ecological drought.


General Description of Study Area
========================================================
- Northern Great Plains - Pine Ridge Reservation
- Climate: semi-arid mid-latitude cold steppe climate (BSk) 
- Elevation: 2,250 - to 3,700 ft (xxx m)
- Precipitation: 15.8 to 17.2 inches (xxx m)
- Mixed-grass prairie with Ponderosa savanna on N. slopes
- Cattle ranching with minor grass & row crops (N-SE)

Study Area Ecoregions
========================================================

- Nebraska Sand Hills: Stabilized sand dunes ($Q_{SH}$)
SW-groundwater interface - constant base flow
- Keya Paha Tablelands: Soft sandstone plains ($T_A$)
Riparian Ash-Elm forest overstory
- Pine Ridge Escarpment: Sandstone ridges ($T_A$)
Ponderosa Pine & Ash-Elm forest overstory
- White River Badlands: Escarpments ($T_{WR}$)
Cottonwood-willow woodlands over turbid ephemeral streams 

Study Area Streams
========================================================
- Low gradient dune-ripple morphology streams 
with well-developed floodplains.   
- Nebraska Sand Hills - Little White River:
Eastward flowing, baseflow dominated E5 stream type 
- Keya Paha Tablelands & Keya Paha Tablelands: North flowing 
mixed-flow, low turbidity C6 or E6 stream-types 
- White River Badlands: North flowing event-dominated, high turbidity 
from constant stream channel adjustment between C6 – G6 – F6 – E6 morphologies.
